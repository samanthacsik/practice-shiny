# Learning shiny is more fun with penguins!

This app is meant to accompany the [Intro to Shiny](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/shiny-workshop/#1) slide deck created for the Bren School's Master of Environmental Science (MEDS) program.

This repo contains a couple apps: 

* The `<myapp>` directory contains the code for the complete app build during the workshop and is hosted at: https://samanthacsik.shinyapps.io/myapp/

* The `<basic_app>` directory contains the code for a very basic version of the app we end up building (basically everything we do up until [slide X]()) and is hosted at: https://samanthacsik.shinyapps.io/basic_app/ 

* The `<two_file_app>` directory contains a `ui.R` and `server.R` script for building an empty app and is for demonstration purposes only. It's not currently hosted online.
